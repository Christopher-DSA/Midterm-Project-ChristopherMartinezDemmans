# Midterm_Project

## Project/Goals
1. Data cleaning and data performing
2. Turning data into visual insights, using Tableau
3. Creating impactful dashboards and story to help stakeholder make decisions
4. Communicating insights with the correct visualizations

## Process
1. Data cleaning and performing EDA
2. Maps for all countries
3. Building models to analyze the whloe dataset
4. Results and analysis
5. Data visualizations
6. Canada as an example
7. Challenges and future work

## Results
1. It is interesting to see, based on the linear regression model, the predictors impact the Happiness Score of a Country. Health and freedom contribute more to the Score, and Trust has a lower impact. At the same time, GDP's value is a bit lower than other, we may need to check it in details. p-value shows 0 is not really 0, it far close to zero and then shows as 0. I tested each single year's data, and the p-value in those tests are not 0. 

2. From linear regression predict model, the MSE value of 0.315 is relatively low, indicating that the model's predictions are, on average, close to the actual happiness scores. However, the interpretation of MSE can be subjective based on the scale of your target variable. However, when predict for Canada, the result is differnt from the prediction by using a distribution plot.

3. Linear regression model with Canada's dataset, the result  shows Economy has negtive correlation and Generosity has the most positive correlation with Canada's Happiness Score. Health has also a strong correlation while Family seems has no linear relationship with the Happiness Score. The result on GDP is wried compared with the result on the whole datasets.

## Challenges 
1. Datasets for Canada is not suffucient
2. GDP vs Score for Canada is wried and can't find the answer for now
3. Limit knowledge about the predict model


## Future Goals
1. Dig deeper to analyze the changes of Canada's rank
2. Make more comparison in terms of before and after covid to see how the indicators' changes afftect the rank or score
